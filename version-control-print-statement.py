print ("Version control is basically a necessity in coding.  The only argument to the contrary is coding for personal reasons; writing programs that arenâ€™t used by anyone else, and specific to a personal problem.  That is to say, version control is necessary because the future is uncertain and is impossible to predict what challenges may arise in the future and, how a specific series of code will interact with hardware that has not been invented yet.  The issue of hardware uncertainty raises another benefit in forking.  If an alternative hardware platform takes a significant market-share, separate, simultaneous versions of the same code may need to exist.  Alternative hardware, and backwards compatibility necessitate version control in projects where multiple people use the same code.  If the code is designed to solve a personal problem, on the current hardware of the author, version control may not be strictly necessary but would still be beneficial.")
